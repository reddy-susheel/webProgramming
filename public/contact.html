            <a>It was just a burger. Why couldn't she understand that? 
                She knew he'd completely changed his life around her eating habits, 
                so why couldn't she give him a break this one time? 
                She wasn't even supposed to have found out. Yes, 
                he had promised her and yes, he had broken that promise, 
                but still in his mind, all it had been was just a burger.

                He took a sip of the drink. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, 
                but at this moment it didn't matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down 
                even if he had absolutely hated it. That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled 
                drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent.
